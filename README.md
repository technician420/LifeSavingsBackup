# LifeSavingsBackup
A manual sync backup of my life savings, too bad it's encrypted for the public. :(

You need to decrypt KeyFileInHere.kbdx with another independent password to gain the keyfile, which is required to gain access to 2025TS.kbdx. All my backups is synced here MANUALLY, that means the containers are closed before I upload to Github.
